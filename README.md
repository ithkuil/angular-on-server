Update: this was several years ago.  The way to do it now is called Angular Universal https://angular.io/guide/universal
Alternatively you can use something like https://prerender.io/

Demo of AngularJS running on server to pre-generate HTML for SEO purposes and initial load, as well as running subsequently on the client.

The detailed explanation is on a [wiki page](https://github.com/ithkuil/angular-on-server/wiki/Running-AngularJS-on-the-server-with-Node.js-and-jsdom).

Requires rethinkdb (you must install this yourself, see link on wiki page above).  Start the application with ./run (required to install the dependencies).
